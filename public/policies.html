            <h2>1. Operational Rules</h2>
            <p>Miraidon Trade Services provides an automated service designed to facilitate in-game Pokémon trades using a Global Queue system processed by three (3) dedicated Nintendo Switch clients.</p>
            <h3>1.1 Trade Queue & Cooldowns</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cooldown:</strong> Users must wait sixty (60) seconds after a completed trade before submitting a new request.</li>
                <li><strong>Queue Limit:</strong> Users may only occupy one (1) position in the Global Queue at any given time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Virtual Items & Risk</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Legality Guarantee:</strong> All Pokémon are 100% legal and pass rigorous internal checks for online use.</li>
                <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Original Trainer (OT) and Secret ID (SID) data are pulled directly from your Nintendo Network ID (NNID) upon trade initiation.</li>
                <li><strong>HOME Disclaimer:</strong> The bot will notify you if a Pokémon lacks a Home Tracker, which may prevent entry into Pokémon HOME.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Risk Acknowledgment</h3>
            <p>Using automated software carries an inherently minuscule risk. You agree that We are not responsible if your Nintendo account or in-game profile is banned, suspended, or restricted by third-party platform owners (Nintendo or The Pokémon Company) regardless of the cause.</p>

            <h2>3. System Reliability</h2>
            <p>We strive for 24/7 uptime. However, since our team members hold external jobs, system crashes or maintenance may take time to resolve. Service depends on third-party servers and proprietary software from genpkm.com.</p>

            <h2>4. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
            <p>Users are prohibited from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attempting to bypass cooldowns, queue limits, or "leddy filters."</li>
                <li>Abusing, harassing, or threatening operators or other users.</li>
                <li>Using the Service for fraudulent or malicious purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Priority Access & Payments</h2>
            <p>The Service is primarily free. Optional <strong>Premium Membership and Bot Rentals</strong> support the purchase and maintenance of our hardware fleet.</p>
            <h3>5.1 Premium Membership and Bot Rentals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Priority Trigger:</strong> Access activates automatically when five (5) or more non-premium members are ahead of you in the queue.</li>
                <li><strong>Weight System:</strong> Priority uses a weighted system to reduce wait times; it does not guarantee an immediate instant jump.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment Methods:</strong> Premium Licenses and Rentals are purchased via <strong>Sell.app</strong>. Non-refundable donations are processed via <strong>Ko-fi</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Refund Policy:</strong> All digital goods (Licenses) and Donations are final and non-refundable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Termination & Disputes</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access at any time. Repeated abuse will result in account banning and potential server blacklisting.</p>
            <p><strong>Dispute Authority:</strong> We are the sole decision-makers regarding punishments. Our ruling is final. By using this service, you agree there shall be no lawsuits or arbitration.</p>
            <p class="font-bold text-center mt-6 text-slate-500 uppercase text-xs">THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE."</p>

            <h1 class="text-3xl font-black text-white mb-6 border-b border-slate-700 pb-4">Refund Policy</h1>
            <p class="italic text-slate-400 mb-6">This Refund Policy explains the terms and conditions regarding refunds for the purchase of the Premium Membership and Bot Rentals on the Miraidon Trade Services, as well as one-time donations.</p>

            <h2>1. Scope of Policy and Non-Refundable Donations</h2>
            <p>This policy applies to all financial contributions made to Miraidon Trade Services, including the <strong>Premium Membership and Bot Rentals</strong> and One-Time Donations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>All One-Time Donations are final and non-refundable.</strong> Donations do not grant priority access to the trading queue or any other membership benefits.</li>
                <li><strong>Premium Membership and Bot Rentals:</strong> Governed by Section 2.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may introduce additional services or products in the future, and those services may be governed by separate or modified refund terms as published at the time of sale.</p>

            <h2>2. Non-Refundable Nature of Premium Membership and Bot Rentals</h2>
            <p>The Premium Membership and Bot Rentals grant priority access to the Miraidon Trade Services trading queue. This access is a digital service provided immediately upon activation and is tied to a specific Discord Server Role ID and the Server ID. The priority service is guaranteed to be available within twenty-four (24) hours of the server owner submitting both required IDs.</p>
            
            <p><strong>All sales of the Premium Membership and Bot Rentals are final and non-refundable.</strong></p>
            <p>Because this membership involves the instantaneous, system-wide activation of a digital priority feature (attached to all current and future bots), we cannot offer refunds, exchanges, or credits for any reason, including, but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Changes in Server Status:</strong> If the Discord server that owns the role is deleted, banned, or loses functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Service Downtime:</strong> Temporary interruptions or downtimes of the Miraidon Trade Services (as noted in our Terms of Service).</li>
                <li><strong>Dissatisfaction:</strong> Dissatisfaction with the queue prioritization system or features.</li>
                <li><strong>Account Termination:</strong> If the server owner's or user's account is suspended or banned due to a violation of the Terms of Service.</li>
                <li><strong>Chargebacks:</strong> Filing a chargeback or payment dispute against the purchase of a Premium Membership or Bot Rental will result in the <strong>immediate and permanent blacklisting</strong> of the associated server and Server ID from accessing the Miraidon Trade Services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Exception for Extended Downtime</h3>
            <p>A refund is never guaranteed and is always at our sole discretion. However, in the event that the Miraidon Trade Services is entirely unavailable for <strong>three (3) consecutive days (72 hours)</strong>, we may, at our sole discretion, issue a prorated refund proportionate to the continuous period of downtime experienced. This exception only applies to the continuous 72-hour period of outage and does not imply a guarantee of service recovery or a waiver of the general non-refundability stated above.</p>

            <h2>3. Payment Processing</h2>
            <p>All payments for One-Time Donations are managed through <strong>Ko-fi</strong>. Any dispute regarding the processing of payment should first be directed to Ko-fi, but this does not alter our policy of non-refundability for the service itself.</p>
            <p>License purchases (Premium/Rental) are Managed by <strong>Sell.app</strong> and Processed by <strong>Square</strong>. These are non-refundable except in the case listed above.</p>

            <h2>4. Contact</h2>
            <p>For questions regarding this policy, please reach out to us at: <a href="mailto:billing@miraidon.ca" class="font-bold text-pink-400">billing@miraidon.ca</a></p>
